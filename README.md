# DDO Life Tracker
First foray into using .NET Maui and an application for cross platform deployment. Dungeons and Dragons Online (DDO) is an MMO that's been around since 2006. Characters in game can
"reincarnate" once hitting the level cap and begin again at starting level, retaining all gear earned along the way and earning a permanent bonus based on the previous life's 
race or class. These bonuses continue to accumulate the more lives a character plays through.

This application is initially designed to track those previous lives by recording the race and class(es) from each life and presenting a dashboard breakdown of the information.

Future plans include:
- Tracking the bonuses the past-lives provide and displaying in dashboard
- Remote storage and retrieval for syncing cross platform
- Output options for display such as HTML/Img based signatures for forums or wallpapers
